# TSPeach Teach yourself to Pronounce 

Communication is everything! For non-native or physically impared english speakers, it can be difficulty and even embarrasing not being able to pronounce certain words. Using Assembly AI we aim to solve this!


### Getting Started
We tried to figure out what kept us connected during the pandemic other then the non ending zoom meetings or the occasional time you spend in class together, and fundamentally this all came down to our ability to just speak and once we started thinking about it we couldn't stop

### Prerequisites

All the libraries used are in requirements.txt, and everything is linked in the index.html file

Example
```
 <script src="assets/js/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
```


### Installing

The github repo can be downloaded, and the project can be locally hosted using http-server using the command in the directory of the file.

```
http-server ./
```

## Feedback

We used assemblyai to get real time transcript of the user input and mark the words that are pronounced inaccurately allowing the user to get instant feedback on their performance.

### Results

The user input is read and if the pronounication is detected to be wrong the algorithm marks these words for the user to study them in the future and perform better in the future

### Conclusion

To conclude, our project works as expected and we hope it allows individuals to gain confidence in their speaking skills to stay conencted in a time like this.
